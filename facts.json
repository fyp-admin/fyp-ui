Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system - that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods."

    "fact" : "Mercury boasts the largest impact crater in the entire solar system, the Caloris Basin. This massive crater is roughly the size of Texas and was likely formed by a giant asteroid impact billions of years ago. The impact was so powerful that it not only left a colossal scar on the planet's surface but also warped the crust and partially melted Mercury's core.  The immense heat generated by the impact is believed to have vaporized rock and dust, creating a temporary atmosphere that likely distributed the impact's energy and helped shape the basin's unique features."

This is hot enough to melt lead and even some metals like tin. This extreme heat is primarily due to a runaway greenhouse effect caused by the thick atmosphere of Venus, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which traps heat from the Sun much more effectively than Earth's atmosphere. Interestingly, the runaway greenhouse effect is believed to be a self-perpetuating cycle, where the increasing heat leads to the release of more greenhouse gases from the planet's interior, further amplifying the problem."

The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That's where the trick of perspective comes in. Because Venus' orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them from our viewpoint, never stray far from each other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning), then another (your 'evening' Venus), just at different times of the year."

This extreme cold is likely due to a combination of factors, including its immense distance from the Sun, which limits the amount of solar radiation it receives, and the lack of internal heat generation compared to gas giants like Jupiter. Despite the frigid temperatures at its upper atmosphere, scientists believe a warmer layer might exist deeper within the planet, potentially influencing its internal dynamics and atmospheric circulation."

Unlike most asteroids, which are irregular in shape, Ceres boasts a nearly spherical shape, suggesting it may have undergone internal geological processes similar to planets. It holds the distinction of being the only known celestial body in the asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, that is both dwarf planet and the largest object. Additionally, unlike most other celestial bodies, Ceres possesses a confirmed atmosphere, composed primarily of water vapor, hinting at the possibility of past internal activity or the presence of subsurface ice."

    "fact" : "Psyche, with a diameter exceeding 200 kilometers, is the largest M-type asteroid and is believed to be the exposed core of a shattered protoplanet – a celestial body that never fully formed into a planet. At current prices, the minerals contained in asteroid 16 Psyche are said to be worth $700 quintillion — enough to give everyone on the planet $93 billion. Psyche is thought to have an irregular, potato-like shape, measuring 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point -- though it's never actually been seen up close.  Unlike most asteroids, which are composed primarily of rock and ice."

    "fact" : "Unlike most asteroids, which are thought to be relatively inactive celestial bodies, Vesta an asteroid exhibits signs of past volcanic activity. Its surface is adorned with evidence of ancient lava flows and basaltic rock formations, indicating a period of internal geological activity billions of years ago. The Dawn mission, which orbited Vesta between 2011 and 2012, captured stunning images and data that continue to be analyzed by scientists today. These observations have not only revealed new details about Vesta's geological history but have also provided valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of asteroids within the solar system."

    "fact" : "Bennu, the target asteroid of the OSIRIS-REx mission, is classified as a near-Earth object (NEO) due to its relatively close approach to Earth's orbit. While its small size makes a direct collision with Earth highly unlikely, studying its composition and trajectory is crucial for developing asteroid deflection strategies should a larger NEO pose a future threat. Additionally, the OSIRIS-REx mission successfully collected a sample from Bennu's surface in 2020, which is currently being analyzed by scientists around the world. This sample holds the potential to reveal valuable information about the potential delivery of essential ingredients for life on Earth by such celestial bodies."

    "fact" : "Ryugu, the peanut-shaped asteroid, explored by the Hayabusa 2 mission, surprised scientists with the discovery of abundant organic materials on its surface, including amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. This finding adds to the growing evidence that asteroids, once thought to be barren rocks, may have played a crucial role in delivering the essential ingredients for life on Earth. Additionally, Ryugu's surface is studded with numerous micrometer-sized diamonds, formed by the intense pressure and heat during the asteroid's formation. These discoveries raise intriguing questions about the potential origins of solar system."

    "fact" : "Itokawa, the target of the Hayabusa mission, is classified as a B-type asteroid, composed primarily of silicate and carbon-rich materials. Interestingly, unlike most asteroids, which are thought to be solid celestial bodies, Itokawa appears to be a loose collection of rubble held together by its own gravity. This suggests that it may have been formed by the collision and fragmentation of a larger asteroid in the past. Studying Itokawa's composition and structure provides valuable insights into the processes that shape their present characteristics. Additionally, the Hayabusa mission successfully collected samples from Itokawa in 2005, which continue to be analyzed by scientists."

Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that can appear twice in a human lifetime. It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061. Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC, but it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet."

    "fact" : "The Great Comet of 1843 was a record-breaking titan that left astronomers awestruck.  Its tail, stretching an incredible 126 million kilometers, held the title of the longest ever observed until 1996.  It is roughly 20 times the distance between Earth and the Moon! Imagine gazing up at the night sky and seeing a luminous streak painting a vast arc across the heavens - that was the Great Comet of 1843. This behemoth belonged to a group of comets called the Kreutz Sungrazers, notorious for their daringly close approaches to the Sun's scorching heat. Unfortunately, due to its extreme and elliptical orbit, the Great Comet won't grace Earth's night sky again for thousands of years."

    "fact" : "The unassuming Swift-Tuttle Comet holds a prestigious place in astronomy. Every 133 years, it orbits the Sun, leaving behind a predictable trail of dust and debris.  In August, Earth intersects this path, and the dust particles superheat in our atmosphere, producing the renowned Perseid meteor shower. These meteors offer a glimpse into the comet's composition, providing valuable data for astronomers studying the formation and evolution of our solar system. Swift-Tuttle's annual light show isn't just a beautiful phenomenon; it's a scientific opportunity, allowing researchers to unravel the mysteries of these icy celestial objects."

Unlike some comets that take centuries to return, Encke's consistent visits allow scientists to track changes and improve our understanding of these cosmic travelers."

Stargazers were treated to a breathtaking display of its twin tails – a dusty yellow one and a fainter, blue ion tail.  Neowise serves as a reminder that exciting astronomical discoveries can still be made, even with advanced technology."

Tragically, 39 members of the group committed mass suicide in 1997, believing they would be beamed aboard a spacecraft following the comet. This event cast a dark shadow over Hale-Bopp's legacy, forever linking its beauty with a heartbreaking human story."
